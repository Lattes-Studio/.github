    <h3>Who we are?</h3>
</div>

Lattes Studio is a small upcoming Studio which holds a LOT of talented developers of the ROBLOX Platform, who joined to start creating the most immersive experiences in the platform. We are glad you have become one of our team, or you're just passing by because of our teaching repositories (yes we do public projects so people can learn from it, and we can get to learn from more experienced developers as well)!

If you're becoming part of the team, welcome aboard! We love to have you around ❤️. If you're interested in becoming part of the Lattes Studio community as a manager/developer or any other position available, make sure to contact us in our social medias and Discord!

- *Sincerely, Lattes Studio's Team* ⚡
